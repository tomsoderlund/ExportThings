-- Updated 2014 by @tomsoderlund
--
-- Somewhat based on "Export Things to text file (ver 1)" by John Wittig
-- and from reading the Things AppleScript Guide (rev 13).
--
-- With contributions by Rob de Jonge - @robdejonge on Twitter
--
-- Tested with Things 2.0.1 and OS X Mountain Lion
--
-- TODO:
-- - Get Repeating ToDos (currently no way via AppleScript).
-- - Make tags tab delimited by heirarchy.
-- - Export Areas. Maybe.
-- - For each exported ToDo, also include their tags and areas. Maybe.
